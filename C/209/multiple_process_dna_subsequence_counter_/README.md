This is a C program that counts all the possible substrings in
all files in the target directory. You can ask it to complete
the tast using severl processes so that it will run faster.

For example :

>make
>./freq5 -d <target dir> -n <num of process> -o <output filename>

# if the number of peocesses is more than the file number in the
# target dir. the program won't run
