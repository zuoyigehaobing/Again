Discussion:
It is possible for starvation to happen, i.e. on some lanes, there is no limitation 
of time for the cars to wait on passing the intersection.
If there exists a lane where the cars in it keep acquiring some of 
the intersection's quadrants, then cars from other lanes would be prevented 
from entering the intersection. That is, the threads for those 
lanes will all be blocked by the mutexes of the quadrants' because there 
is one thread always keeps those mutexes. Then starvation 
occurs. e.g. The north lane filled with cars want to move to south, and they always 
succeed in acquiring Q2's and Q3's mutexes. Then if cars come from other 
directions need Q2's and Q3's mutexes, the chances are that they would 
never be able to cross the intersection.
