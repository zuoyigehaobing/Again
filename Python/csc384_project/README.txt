Welcome to Gomoku!!!

To start, run following code on terminal (works with python 2.7)

    	python GUI.py

On the menu:
	Choose the option on the left to set the AI to 

	Simple-1:  game tree search with depth 1, Player goes first
	Simple-2:  game tree search with depth 1, AI goes first
	Normal-1:  game tree search with depth 3(with alpha beta cut),
	 	    Player goes first
	Normal-2:  game tree search with depth 3(with alpha beta cut),
	            AI goes first

	##if you want try different depths, you can actually manually set the depth
	## in the minimax search.However, if it is larger than 4,the time cost 
	## to return next state would be crazy long.


click Quit to exit the game
